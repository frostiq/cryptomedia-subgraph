# Cryptomedia subgraph

> All cryptomedia NFTs in one subgraph

More about subgraphs and The Graph protocol you can find [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/introduction).

### Deliverables for the NFT subgraph:

- Query created NFTs by address
- Query owned NFTs by address
- Query NFT metadata by NFT
- Query per platform
- Have all platforms smart contracts integrated 

The challenge is to be able to pull from:
- [x] [Rarible](https://rarible.com/)
- [x] [Superrare](https://www.superrare.co/)
- [x] [Known Origin](https://knownorigin.io/)
- [x] [Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/)
- [x] [Zora](https://zora.co/)
- [ ] [Foundation](https://foundation.app/)
- [x] [Meme](https://dontbuymeme.com/)

And having an open GitHub so anyone can PR new smart contracts associated with those platforms.
